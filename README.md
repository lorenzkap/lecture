# Reinforcement Learning Mini-Course

This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks designed to introduce key concepts in Reinforcement Learning. Each lecture includes explanations, complete code examples, interactive experiments, and visualizations. All notebooks are compatible with Google Colab and can also be run locally.

## Lecture 1: Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB)
- Understanding the exploration–exploitation dilemma  
- Epsilon-Greedy strategy with sample-average updates  
- Q-Learning with Temporal Difference (TD) updates  
- Interactive hyperparameter exploration

## Lecture 2: Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)
- Difference between Q-values and rewards  
- Q-Learning as Off-Policy TD learning  
- Implementation of a GridWorld environment  

---

## Lecture 3: Deep Q-Networks (DQN)
- Function approximation using Neural Networks  
- Experience Replay and Target Networks to improve stability  
- Applying DQN to the GridWorld environment  

---

## Lecture 4: DQN on Continuous Environments
- Introduction to the Gymnasium library (e.g., CartPole)  
- Deep Q-Learning with experience replay  
- Epsilon-greedy exploration decay  
- Evaluation and performance analysis

## Homework Assignment

The homework consists of:  
1. **Reading and understanding Lectures 1–3.**  
2. **Completing the exercises in Lecture 4.**  
3. **Submitting the filled-out Jupyter notebook (.ipynb file) via email.**

## Getting Started

Each lecture is provided as a Jupyter notebook that includes:
- Complete and runnable code  
- Interactive experiments  
- Visualizations and analysis  
- Compatibility with Google Colab

## Running the Notebooks

You can run the notebooks in one of the following ways:

### Option 1: Locally
1. Clone the repository  
2. Install the required dependencies  
3. Open the notebooks using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab  

### Option 2: Google Colab
Each notebook includes a link at the top to open it directly in Colab. Uploading your completed homework notebook can also be done from Colab before sending it by email.
